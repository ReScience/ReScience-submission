abstract: "Since the first description of spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), different models
            of STDP have been published to reproduce different experimental findings.
            Clopath et al. (2010) introduced a STDP model which is able to reproduce the experimental findings of triplet studies.
            They implemented a homeostatic mechanism to control the level of generated LTD, based on the relationship between the average postsynaptic membrane
potential and a reference value. With this voltage-based STDP rule thei reproduce a wide range of physiological experiments.
We here present a reimplementation of the Clopath et al . (2010) learning rule in Python with the help of the neuro-simulator ANNarchy."
