	abstract = {In cultures of dissociated rat hippocampal neurons, persistent potentiation and depression of glutamatergic synapses were induced by correlated spiking of presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons. The relative timing between the presynaptic and postsynaptic spiking determined the direction and the extent of synaptic changes. Repetitive postsynaptic spiking within a time window of 20 msec after presynaptic activation resulted in long-term potentiation (LTP), whereas postsynaptic spiking within a window of 20 msec before the repetitive presynaptic activation led to long-term depression (LTD). Significant LTP occurred only at synapses with relatively low initial strength, whereas the extent of LTD did not show obvious dependence on the initial synaptic strength. Both LTP and LTD depended on the activation of NMDA receptors and were absent in cases in which the postsynaptic neurons were GABAergic in nature. Blockade of L-type calcium channels with nimodipine abolished the induction of LTD and reduced the extent of LTP. These results underscore the importance of precise spike timing, synaptic strength, and postsynaptic cell type in the activity-induced modification of central synapses and suggest that Hebb{\textquoteright}s rule may need to incorporate a quantitative consideration of spike timing that reflects the narrow and asymmetric window for the induction of synaptic modification.},

	abstract = {Activity-dependent synaptic plasticity is critical for learning and memory. Considerable attention has been paid to mechanisms that increase or decrease synaptic efficacy, referred to as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), respectively. It is becoming apparent that synaptic activity also modulates the ability to elicit subsequent synaptic changes. We provide direct experimental evidence that this modulation is attributable, at least in part, to variations in the level of postsynaptic depolarization required for inducing plasticity. In slices from adult hippocampal CA1, a brief pairing protocol known to produce LTP can also induce LTD. The voltage{\textendash}response function for the induction of LTD and LTP in naive synapses exhibits three parts: at a postsynaptic membrane potential during pairing (Vm) <= -40 mV, no synaptic modification is obtained; at Vmbetween -40 and -20 mV, LTD is induced; and, finally, atVm \&gt; -20 mV, LTP is generated. This function varies with initial synaptic efficacy. In depressed synapses, Θ-, the Vm above which LTD is generated, is shifted toward more depolarizedVms and Θ+, the LTD{\textendash}LTP crossover point or, equivalently, the Vmabove which LTP is induced, toward more polarizedVms. Conversely in potentiated synapses, Θ- is shifted toward more polarizedVms. Therefore synaptic activity changes synaptic efficacy and accordingly adjusts the voltages for eliciting subsequent synaptic modifications. The concomitant shifts in the voltages for inducing LTD and LTP in opposite directions promote synaptic potentiation and inhibit synaptic depression in depressed synapses and vice versa in potentiated synapses.},
