### Data repository

There are no extra data necessary, except for the simple-cell-like receptive field task.
The images therefore can be found online (http://www.rctn.org/bruno/sparsenet/). Please note, that the whitened natural scenes are required. Put the extracted Matlab file in the same directory as the **Fig4_RF.py** file.
