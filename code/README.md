* `RecurrentNetwork.py` contains a class implementing the recurrent network. It cannot be run, only imported by other scripts.
* The `Fig1.py`, `Fig2.py`, `Fig3.py` scripts allow to reproduce the corresponding figures of the article. They are simply executed:

```{.bash}
$ python Fig1.py
```

Before running `Fig2.py`, make sure you have downloaded the corresponding data by executing `data/get_handwriting.sh`.

* `Fig3-Load.py` allows to plot Fig. 3, without actually running the simulation.
