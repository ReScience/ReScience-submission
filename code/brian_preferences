# We switch off logging debug information to a file. While this file will
# be automatically deleted in case no error occured, it can grow to several GB
# of size during the run, due to the fact that we create a great number of
# independent simulations.

# Note that this preferences while will be used by Brian automatically. We
# cannot set these preferences in the simulation script itself, because the
# logging system will be set up as soon as the brian2 package is imported --
# setting these preferences later in the script will therefore have no effect.
