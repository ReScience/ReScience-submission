    "This paper describes our efforts to implement, acquire similar results and improvement of the ones achieved by the authors of article. We follow the steps and models described in their article and the same public data sets of EEG Signals. Epilepsy affects more than 65 million people globally and EEG Signals are very important to analyze and recognize epilepsy. Although the efforts in the last years it is still very difficult to extract useful information from this signals and select useful features from numerous them in diagnostic application. We construct a deep convolution network and autoencoders-based model (AE-CDNN) in order to perform unsupervised feature learning. We use the AE-CDNN to extract the features of the available data sets, and then we use some common classifiers to classify the features. The results obtained demonstrate that the proposed AE-CDNNN to perform the traditional feature extraction based classification techniques by achieving better accuracy of classification."

    "Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder and it is becoming one of the most common neurological diseases in the world. Approximately $1\\%$ of world's population is affected by epilepsy representing more than 65 million people affected. This disorder is characterized by the occurrence of spontaneous convulsions due to the abnormal synchronous firing of the cortical neurons. This physical reaction can generate many problems to patients, including physical harm caused by the loss of consciousness, shame and discrimination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Frequent seizures are dangerous conditions because, at the moment of disruption of the body can occur falls, fractures, burns, car accidents, and other serious physical injuries. Epilepsy can be defined as a permanent predisposition in the brain to cause epileptic seizures.\n",
    "\n",
    "A person is diagnosed with epilepsy if they have two unprovoked seizures (or one unprovoked seizure with the likelihood of more) that were not caused by some known and reversible medical condition like alcohol withdrawal or extremely low blood sugar. Even when correctly diagnosed and treated, the epileptic patient still suffers side effects and sporadic seizures. The epileptic seizures can cause even irreversible damage to brain, then we can visualize the importance of analyzing epilepsy to improve the life quality and the medical treatments for these patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "To confirm the diagnostic, epileptologists should usually visually inspect the long-term electroencephalograms of the scalp (EEG). Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a measure of the voltage fluctuation generated by the ion current of neurons in the brain, which reflects the activity of the brain’s bio-electricity and may contain many physiological and disease information. \n",
    "\n",
    "When it was discovered that during a patient's seizure the brain activity changes the EEG has become the most common epilepsy diagnostic tool. Many studies have been made and the general problem consists in acquiring methods to efficiently classify the patients' EEG signals. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, this costly task still presents several challenges for automatic crisis detection, among them: The scarce number of public data sets; The lack of standardization in seizure classification methodologies; The lack of standardization of data preprocessing; The cost of a specialist to label time intervals; The unbalance of the time series given the rare occurrence of the event; The difficulty of reproducing the works in the literature.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this problem in hand, this paper reproduces the results obtained in <a id=\"ref-1\" href=\"#cite-WenZha\">Wen and Zhang 2018</a>, with public data labeled and preprocessed. In addition, we get new results by combining the proposal classifiers into a classifier by set voting, and we add new metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section [5](#related) presents few works related to classification of epileptic seizures in EGG. Section [6](#propose) introduce the methodological proposal employed, and their differences with the work of [WenZha](https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2833746). Section [7](#metho) lists the experimental validation process using epilepsy datasets. Section [8](#resu) presents the corresponding results and analyzes our approach. Finally, Conclusions were summarized in Section [9](#concl)."

    "Several papers use automated methods for detecting seizures. We can extract several discriminative characteristics of the signals, among them, we mention the autocorrelation, probability of synchronization, functional connectivity network properties, EEG morphology and the reconstructed powers of the time series. \n",

    "The oscillatory characteristics present in the time series of patients with epilepsy were extensively studied by temporal frequency analysis for classification $\\cite{saab2005system,kuhlmann2009seizure,shoeb2004patient,shoeb2011machine}$. Using this technique, we mention the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), which, despite requiring hand-designed parameters, it is the most used $\\cite{ullah2018automated}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the literature, there is no common rule for manually label seizures in databases, which makes it difficult to compare the results of these methods. Besides the few papers that use the same sets, there are few that are looking for the same task.\n",

    "In $\\cite{chua2011application}$ it is used High Order Spectra (HOS) and spectrum-based energy resources for the automated detection of epilepsy. The proposed method yields good results when using Gaussian Mixture (GMM) for classification ($93.11\\%$ and $88.78\\%$). In $\\cite{nicolaou2012detection}$ we have that the authors extracted the entropy of the permutation of the signals, and employed these in an SVM for classification. The result of this methodology, acquired $93.55\\%$ for our first database, in task A vs E.\n",

In the line of deep learning algorithms, CNNs attract a growing interest in the literature. In $\\cite{hussein2018epileptic}$ they propose a CNN that learns based on the spectral information of each channel and a LSTM network with a single layer to classify the channels of the objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\cite{xun2016detecting}$ propose an approach unusual when decoding each window of possible interval as an ``EGG word`` from the `EEG` dictionary. They explore temporal knowledge by learning context information from EEG fragments (Context-EEG). The authors obtained a $22.93\\%$ error rate in the control classification vs epileptic crisis using the second dataset present in $\\cite{WenZha}$. \n",

    "$\\cite{emami2019autoencoding}$ obtained $100\\%$ sensitivity with a simpler methodology than our. For each channel, it builds a autoencoder and through the error of reconstruction is classified. The dataset was self and with no access available.

Attention is drawn to the $0$ values presented in the MLP, SVM1 methods. The average of the methods does not exceed our Ensemble method in any scenario.

Thus, as training is already costly, the complexity of the classification algorithm must be minimized. K-NN and ADB have a lower complexity than the others, and a result close to the champion method. The difference in the performance of the SVM2 method in F-measure with our Ensemble method is close, the difference in averages is only $0.0002$. Also, looking at the behavior of the classifiers by the Bayesian Test \\cite{benavoli2017time}, we have that the Ensemble method is $52.4 \\%$ better than SVM2 on Acurracy. We consider a more conservative analysis with rope = $0$ and runs= $5$, shown in Figure \\ref{fig:acc-bay}."

    "In this article, we re-implemented the approach proposed by \\cite{WenZha} an investigation of the accurately tested feature sizes and proposed a new classifier. This classification approach, based on deep learning for detecting epileptic seizures using EGG, had not been explored previously. We adopted a self-concealment that allows us to construct a smaller representation space. Among the variety of metrics, our method stands out according to the ROC curve. The proposed approach still needs further investigation into the details of the parameters tested by the authors. The method is easily portable to other tasks and codes are a byproduct of this work. As future work we can employ data augmentation that would allow the method to better learn the parameters adopted."
