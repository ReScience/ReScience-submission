This is a replication of the following article:

Verbyla DL, Litvaitis JA (1989) Resampling methods for evaluating classification accuracy
of wildlife habitat models. Environmental Management 13:783-787 https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01868317

where the authors examined different resampling methods to test wildife habitat models.
