# Introduction

We provide an implementation of the model of [@Compte03_2707], which reproduces single-neuron and collective network
behaviors during slow-wave oscillations in vitro in control conditions and under pharmacological manipulations.
In particular, we focus on the authors' model results that include: (a) neuronal membrane potentials oscillating
between Up and Down states at $<\!\!1\,\mathrm{Hz}$; (b) characteristic membrane resistance behavior and activation of neuronal
ion channels with proportional excitation and inhibition during Up states; (c) spontaneous and stimulus-evoked initiation and further
wave-like propagation of population spiking activity. The original implementation is in
C\nolinebreak[4]\hspace{-0.05em}\raisebox{.4ex}{\tiny{\bf ++}}, but the source code is not publicly available. 
The implementation we propose is coded in the NEST [@Gewaltig_07_11204] framework, one of the modern actively 
developed simulation platforms that is publicly available. The code uses the Python interface [@Eppler09_12] for 
legibility. The model and analysis scripts are implemented using Python 2.7.6.


# Methods

We use the description of the model given in the original study, with the exception of the synaptic kinetics, which
is greatly simplified (see model description below). In the original model, the majority of parameters are given
per unit membrane surface area. For simplicity, we combine these parameters with the surface areas of the corresponding 
compartments in the following description. The resulting parameters are denoted with a tilde.


The model for excitatory neurons contains a somatic and a dendritic compartment. The somatic compartment includes fast
$\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ spiking currents ($\widetilde{I}_{\mathrm{Na}}$, $\widetilde{I}_{\mathrm{K}}$), 
a leak current $\widetilde{I}_{\mathrm{L}}$, a fast A-type $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ current $\widetilde{I}_{\mathrm{A}}$, a 
non-inactivating slow $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ current $\widetilde{I}_{\mathrm{KS}}$, and a $\mathrm{Na}{}^{+}$-dependent 
$\mathrm{K}^{+}$ current $\widetilde{I}_{\mathrm{KNa}}$. The dendritic compartment includes a high-threshold 
$\mathrm{Ca}{}^{2+}$ current $\widetilde{I}_{\mathrm{Ca}}$, a $\mathrm{Ca}{}^{2+}$-dependent $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ current 
$\widetilde{I}_{\mathrm{KCa}}$, a non-inactivating (persistent) $\mathrm{Na}{}^{+}$ current $\widetilde{I}_{\mathrm{NaP}}$, 
and an inward rectifier (activated by hyperpolarization) non-inactivating $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ current $\widetilde{I}_{\mathrm{AR}}$. 
Somato-dendritic coupling is implemented through the axial dendritic conductance $g_{\mathrm{sd}}$. Non-synaptic currents 
are modeled using the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism $\widetilde{I}\left(t\right)=\tilde{g}m^{k}h^{l}\left(V-E_{\mathrm{rev}}\right)$, 
where gating variables $m$ and $h$ are calculated using a first-order activation scheme, 
$\frac{dx}{dt}=\phi\left[\alpha\left(V\right)\left(1-x\right)-\beta\left(V\right)x\right]=\left(x_{\infty}\left(V\right)-x\right)/\tau\left(V\right)$
with $x_{\infty}=\frac{\alpha}{\alpha+\beta}$, $\tau=\frac{1}{\phi\left(\alpha+\beta\right)}$, and $\phi$ being the temperature factor 
(constant). In cases where time dependence is neglected (due to rapid activation or inactivation), gating variables are 
substituted by their saturation levels $m_{\infty}$ or $h_{\infty}$. The concentration of intrinsic neuronal $\mathrm{Ca}{}^{2+}$
and $\mathrm{Na}{}^{+}$ ions (in mM) is drawn from first-order differential equations 
$\frac{d\left[\mathrm{Ca}{}^{2+}\right]}{dt}=\alpha_{\mathrm{\mathrm{Ca}}}\widetilde{I}_{\mathrm{Ca}}-\left[\mathrm{Ca}{}^{2+}\right]/\tau_{\mathrm{Ca}}$
and $\frac{d\left[\mathrm{Na}{}^{+}\right]}{dt}=\alpha_{\mathrm{Na}}(\widetilde{I}_{\mathrm{Na}}+\widetilde{I}_{\mathrm{NaP}})-R_{\mathrm{pump}}
\left(\left[\mathrm{Na}{}^{+}\right]^{3}/\left(\left[\mathrm{Na}{}^{+}\right]^{3}+15^{3}\right)-\left[\mathrm{Na}{}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{eq}}^{3}/
\left(\left[\mathrm{Na}{}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{eq}}^{3}+15^{3}\right)\right)$
where $\alpha_{\mathrm{Ca}}$, $\alpha_{\mathrm{Na}}$, $\tau_{\mathrm{Ca}}$, $R_{\mathrm{pump}}$, $\left[\mathrm{Na}{}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{eq}}$
are constants. The model for inhibitory neurons just consists of a somatic compartment with only $\widetilde{I}_{\mathrm{Na}}$, 
$\widetilde{I}_{\mathrm{\mathrm{K}}}$, and $\widetilde{I}_{\mathrm{L}}$ currents. AMPA and NMDA synaptic inputs target the 
dendritic compartment for excitatory and the somatic compartment for inhibitory neurons. GABA inputs always target the somatic compartment. 

Because of the complexity of the single-neuron model (with multiple voltage-dependent channels), we verify that our 
implementation behaves like the original according to the information given in the paper. Similar to the original work, $500\,\mathrm{ms}$
injection of $250\,\mathrm{pA}$ current into the soma (Fig.$\,$@fig:bm-neuron) results in an adapting firing pattern in pyramidal (PY) 
and non-adapting firing in fast-spiking (FS) neurons with average firing rates of $22$ and $76$ spikes/s, respectively. 
Distribution of the membrane leak conductance with 10\% (PY) and 2.5\% (FS) standard deviation around the mean value leads 
to a small fraction of PY and a negligible fraction of FS neurons showing spontaneous activity.


![**Model response to 250 pA current injection for 500 ms into the soma of a pyramidal (PY) (A) and a fast-spiking (FS) (B) neuron.** 
The respective mean rates of 22 spikes/s for the PY neuron and 76 spikes/s for the FS neuron over the input period match those 
in the original implementation of Compte et al. [@Compte03_2707].](../code/fig1.png){#fig:bm-neuron}


The notable difference in our implementation is the synaptic kinetics. In the original model, synaptic gating variables 
depend on the presynaptic membrane potential. Implementing such a dependence is at present highly nontrivial in NEST due 
to optimizations for distributed computing (see Kunkel et al. [@Kunkel14_78], Hahne et al. [@Hahne15_00022] for background). 
For this reason, we simplify the synapse models while preserving the amplitude and shape of postsynaptic conductances. 
Specifically, the first-order kinetics of AMPA and GABA channels is replaced by a simple exponential decay 
$\frac{\partial g}{\partial t}=\underset{i}{\sum}W\delta\left(t-t_{i}\right)-\frac{g}{\tau}$, where g is the synaptic conductance, 
$\tau$ is the synaptic decay time, $W$ is the synaptic weight, and $i$ indexes the incoming spike times. The second-order kinetics 
of NMDA channels is substituted by a difference of slow and fast exponential components, 
$g^{\mathrm{NMDA}}=g_{\mathrm{slow}}^{\mathrm{NMDA}}-g_{\mathrm{fast}}^{\mathrm{NMDA}}$ with 
$\frac{dg_{\mathrm{slow/fast}}}{dt}=\underset{i}{\sum}W\delta\left(t-t_{i}\right)-\frac{g_{\mathrm{slow/fast}}}{\tau_{\mathrm{slow/fast}}}$. 
These simplifications are justified by the stereotyped trajectory of the presynaptic membrane potential during an action potential. 
Further, these simplifications allow us to merge gating variables $s$ of all synapses of one type (AMPA, NMDA or GABA) into a single 
postsynaptic time-dependent conductance (see Table @tbl:syn-values). While multiple activations of the 
same synapse lead to linear summation of postsynaptic AMPA and GABA conductances in the original model, NMDA conductances saturate at high 
input rates. We model such behavior using the short-term plasticity formalism suggested by [@Markram98]. In short, the amplitude 
of the postsynaptic current $PSC=A\cdot R\cdot u$ is proportional to the fraction of available synaptic efficacy $R$ and 
utilization of synaptic efficacy $u$. Spike-triggered synaptic activation leads to a reduction of the available synaptic efficacy 
(corresponding to short-term depression) together with an increase in the utilization of synaptic efficacy (corresponding 
to short-term facilitation). In the time period $\Delta t$  between subsequent spikes, $R$ and $u$ recover to corresponding 
resting-state values ($R_{0}=1$ and $u_{0}=U$) with time constants $\tau_{\mathrm{rec}}$ and $\tau_{\mathrm{facil}}$. 
Our implementation closely follows the behavior of the original synapse model (Fig.$\,$@fig:bm-syn). Note that the equation 
describing the dynamics of the NMDA gating variable $s$ in the original paper contains a misprint and should read 

$$ \frac{ds}{dt}=\alpha(1-s)x-s/\tau. $$ {#eq:1}
 

![**Simplified synaptic kinetics (dashed curve) for AMPA, NMDA, and GABA conductances closely reproduces the behavior 
of the original model (solid curve) in a wide range of spiking rates.** DC currents, simultaneous injected into the soma of a presynaptic 
excitatory and an inhibitory neuron for $500\,\mathrm{ms}$, lead to synaptic activation of the postsynaptic by the presynaptic neuron at rates of $4$, $14$, $22$ spikes/s (top to bottom) 
for AMPA and NMDA, and $14$, $36$, $52$ spikes/s for GABA channels. These synaptic activation rates span the range of excitatory 
and inhibitory neuronal firing rates observed during Up states in the model. Curves for the original model obtained with the help of a 
reimplementation of the single-neuron and synapse dynamics in Python. To construct this figure, synaptic inputs with a 
weight of $W=1\,\mathrm{nS}$ were provided to AMPA (A), NMDA (B), and GABA (C) channels for the original implementation. Note that 
due to gating variable $s$ in the original implementation, the effective amplitude of a single synaptic input differs from 
the synaptic weight. For the implementation with simplified synaptic kinetics, synaptic weights are chosen to match the 
amplitude of the initial postsynaptic response in the original implementation.](../code/fig2.png){#fig:bm-syn}

The network architecture represents a chain of excitatory and inhibitory neurons (of length $l_{\mathrm{chain}}$) equidistantly 
distributed over $5\,\mathrm{mm}$. Each neuron projects a given total number (drawn from a Gaussian distribution) of outgoing connections. 
The probability of a connection between any two neurons decays with inter-neuronal distance according to a Gaussian 
$P(x)=\exp(-\frac{x^2}{2\lambda^2})/\sqrt{2 \pi \lambda^2}$ with characteristic scales $\lambda_{e}$ and $\lambda_{i}$ for excitatory and inhibitory presynaptic 
neuron types, respectively. Excitatory connections include both AMPA and NMDA channels, while inhibitory connections use GABA channels. 
Multiple connections can exist for a given pair of neurons. In Tables$\;$@tbl:Model-summary$\;\!$--@tbl:neuron-values 
we provide the description of the model.

The simulations are performed with NEST 2.8.0 [@Nest280] and combine an adaptive step size for the single-neuron solver with 
communication between neurons at a step size of $0.1\,\mathrm{ms}$. The time resolution of all recordings is $0.1\,\mathrm{ms}$. 

In Fig.$\,$@fig:result-intra$\,\!$E 
excitatory and inhibitory conductances are filtered with a $40\,\mathrm{ms}$ rectangular kernel. This kernel width is chosen to yield 
average input levels, rather than individual synaptic events. We find that filtering is required to reproduce the proportionality 
of excitatory and inhibitory conductances, shown in the original Figure 6, although no corresponding information is given in the original paper.

To estimate the neuronal membrane conductance according to Eq.$\,$@eq:G-exp-def in the model at a time $t_{0}$ near the membrane potential $V_{0}$,
we use a procedure we refer to as the “virtual hyperpolarization method” (schematically shown in Fig.$\,$@fig:R-scheme). First, 
an isolated copy of a neuron model instance is created with its state identical to that of the original neuron at the time of interest $t_{0}$. 
Then, the neuron is allowed to relax to its equilibrium state, while being clamped to the corresponding membrane potential $V_{0}$. 
In this steady-state configuration, the total cross-membrane current $I_{0}$ is calculated as the sum of all channel currents 
according to Eq.$\,$@eq:I-as-sum. Then the neuron is slightly hyperpolarized to potential $V_{1}$ and the corresponding steady-state 
current $I_{1}$ is calculated. The ratio $\Delta{I}/\Delta{V}$ then gives an estimate of the membrane conductance at time $t_{0}$. 
This approach can be applied to the case where the membrane is approximately isopotential across the whole neuron (true for the present model). 
In case of more complex non-isopotential multi-compartment neurons, the corresponding equilibrium currents $I_{0}$ and $I_{1}$ should be 
estimated through direct simulation. Note that during this procedure the state of the synaptic input should be fixed at the level of time $t_{0}$. 

The relaxation time constant of certain ion concentrations (e.g., $80$--$350\,\mathrm{ms}$ for intracellular $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ [@Markram1995_1], [@Schiller1995_583]) 
can be much larger than the membrane time constant (on average $<\!\!20\,\mathrm{ms}$ at rest, e.g., [@Levy2012_5609]) in cortical neurons. Therefore, the 
typical duration of DC pulse injection ($\sim\!\!80$ ms [@Contreras96], [@Waters06_8267]) used in experiments with active networks is enough 
to overcome the transient phase of prominent capacitive currents, while certain ion concentrations might be not equilibrated. 
In the present model, however, the membrane relaxation time constant reaches hundreds of milliseconds (see relaxation phase 
in Fig.$\,$@fig:IV), which makes it difficult to separate these two effects. Therefore, in our application of the virtual 
hyperpolarization method to the model we consider limit cases of both instantaneous (frozen) and equilibrated ion concentrations.

![**Schematic representation of the virtual hyperpolarization method.** An isolated copy of a neuron model instance is created with its 
state identical to that of the original neuron at the time of interest $t_{0}$, including the level of synaptic input. Then the 
cross-membrane current $I_{0}$, required to keep the neuron clamped to membrane potential $V_{0}$ in the steady-state scenario, 
is determined. After that, the neuron is slightly hyperpolarized to the potential $V_{1}$ and the corresponding steady-state current 
$I_{1}$ is estimated. The resulting ratio $\Delta I/\Delta V$ then gives the conductance estimate at time $t_{0}$. 
In case of an isopotential neuron model, the corresponding currents $I_{0}$ and $I_{1}$ can be calculated using 
Eq.$\,$@eq:I-as-sum.](../code/fig3.png){#fig:R-scheme}

# Results

We here focus on the main activity regime of the model, namely Up-Down oscillations that are either spontaneously generated or induced by stimulation. 
First, we simulate the reimplemented model with the parameters corresponding to the original paper. The simulated activity, however, is characterized 
by unreasonably high firing rates due to the dominance of NMDA conductances far exceeding the potency of the opposing GABAergic inhibition.
This difference from the original results might be a consequence of the different implementation of synaptic dynamics.
Closer examination of the original Figure 5C suggests that unitary excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic responses are approximately $0.5\,\mathrm{nS}$ during 
periods of network silence. This contradicts our implementation of the non-modified synaptic dynamics (see Fig.$\,$@fig:bm-syn), 
where single synaptic activations (with synaptic weights as in the original model) would result in $5.4$ and $0.8\,\mathrm{nS}$ 
postsynaptic response for AMPA and GABA channels, respectively. This suggests an inconsistency between the reported dynamics and 
that which was implemented already in the original work. Furthermore, we assumed the units of the function defining the dependence of the synaptic conductances on the presynaptic membrane potential to be $\mathrm{ms^{-1}}$, but this is not strictly specified in the original work, providing another potential source of discrepancies.

To achieve an appropriate network regime, we modify the synaptic strengths $W$ of all synapse types. Specifically, we match the firing rates, the duration of Up and Down states, the wave propagation speed, and the response to network stimulation. Corresponding synaptic strengths for the model 
with simplified synaptic dynamics are given in Table @tbl:syn-values. When transformed back to the original implementation (i.e., excluding 
the synaptic gating variable $s$), the modified strengths are
$g_{\mathrm{ee}}^{\mathrm{AMPA}}=6.6\,\mathrm{nS}$, 
$g_{\mathrm{ee}}^{\mathrm{NMDA}}=0.1\,\mathrm{nS}$, 
$g_{\mathrm{ei}}^{\mathrm{AMPA}}=2.8\,\mathrm{nS}$, 
$g_{\mathrm{ei}}^{\mathrm{NMDA}}=0\,\mathrm{nS}$, 
$g_{\mathrm{ie}}^{\mathrm{GABA}}=97\,\mathrm{nS}$, 
$g_{\mathrm{ii}}^{\mathrm{GABA}}=12\,\mathrm{nS}$. 
However, a range of different synaptic weight settings was able to produce qualitatively identical network activity. 
Therefore, we chose a set of weights from among these possibilities based on relative proximity to the originally reported weight values.
Besides the reasons mentioned above, 
differences between the simplified and original synaptic kinetics during network activity, not brought out by the simple inputs in Fig.$\,$@fig:bm-syn, 
may contribute to the need for weight changes to obtain a network state similar to that in the original study. However, this is unlikely 
to account for the need to strongly increase the inhibitory weights relative to the excitatory ones. In the absence of the original code and since our 
network implementation does not allow using the original synapse dynamics, we cannot resolve this issue here.

The adjusted weights result in periods of spontaneously generated activity (Up states) which propagate along the network in a wave-like fashion 
(Fig.$\,$@fig:result-spikes$\,\!$A) with propagation speed $3-7\,\mathrm{mm/s}$. On the level of individual neurons, Up states are characterized 
by a depolarized membrane potential and an increase of the intracellular concentration of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ ions by $3$--$4.5\,\mathrm{mM}$ 
(Fig.$\,$@fig:result-spikes$\,\!$C,D for two neurons), similar to the results shown in Figure 2 of the original work. When excitatory neurons are 
slightly hyperpolarized to reduce the level of spontaneous activity, external stimulation of $40$ adjacent excitatory neurons can initiate Up state propagation 
(Fig.$\,$@fig:result-stim$\,\!$A) with the firing rate profiles (Fig.$\,$@fig:result-stim$\,\!$C) being similar to those shown in Figure 3D of the original work.
The histogram of the intervals between the first spike of each pyramidal cell and its immediately adjacent interneuron (Fig.$\,$@fig:result-stim$\,\!$B) closely 
resembles the original result in Figure 3C. In analogy to the original work, repeated network stimulation within a few seconds after the first one does not 
evoke an Up state transition (Fig.$\,$@fig:result-stim$\,\!$A).

During the spontaneous Up-Down oscillations shown in Fig.$\,$@fig:result-spikes$\,\!$A, synaptic and intrinsic neuronal conductances (Fig.$\,$@fig:result-intra$\,\!$B--I) are tightly coupled to the membrane depolarization (Fig.$\,$@fig:result-intra$\,\!$A) and show a dynamic range very similar to that reported in the 
original Figure 5. When filtered with a rectangular kernel (see Methods), excitatory and inhibitory conductances are clearly coupled (Fig.$\,$@fig:result-intra$\,\!$E), like in the original model (see their Figure 6). 

When computed as the reciprocal of the sum of all conductances (see Eq.$\,$@eq:G-model-def), membrane resistance is decreased during Up states 
relative to silent Down states (Fig.$\,$@fig:result-intra$\,\!$B,$\,$@fig:result-R), consistent with the results shown in Figure 5B of the original work. 
We also estimated membrane resistance by injecting hyperpolarizing DC pulses ($300\,\mathrm{pA}$ for $100\,\mathrm{ms}$) into neurons, constantly hyperpolarized by $250\,\mathrm{pA}$
current injection (see Fig.$\,$@fig:result-R$\,\!$A), similar to the way described in the original Figure 4. In agreement with the original paper, 
the resulting membrane resistance, computed as the voltage deflection at the end of the pulse divided by the pulse amplitude (Fig.$\,$@fig:result-R$\,\!$B 
dots) is quantitatively similar to the values obtained with the reciprocal of Eq.$\,$@eq:G-model-def (Fig.$\,$@fig:result-R solid line) at 
least for membrane potentials below $-80\,\mathrm{mV}$.

However, note that the authors define membrane conductance as 

$$ G_{\mathrm{m}}^{\mathrm{model}}=\underset{i}{\sum}G_{i}\left(V\right) $$ {#eq:G-model-def} 

\noindent where $G_{i}$ are the instantaneous conductances of all ionic channels, which are typically time- and voltage-dependent. This definition corresponds 
to the “instantaneous chord conductance” according to the classification given by [@Jack1983]. In contrast, the typical experimentally measured quantity 
corresponds to “steady-state slope conductance” from the same classification: 

$$ G_{\mathrm{m}}^{\mathrm{exp}}=\frac{\Delta I}{\Delta V} $$ {#eq:G-exp-def}

\noindent where $\Delta I$ is the extra current (injected into the soma) required to achieve a steady-state membrane potential shift $\Delta V=V-V_{0}$ from 
the initial level $V_{0}$ (prior to current injection). The steady state here refers to the situation where transient capacitive currents 
become negligible. To compare these two definitions we use the fact that in the steady-state case, the externally injected current $I$ is equal 
to minus the sum of all ionic currents, 

$$ I=\underset{i}{\sum}G_{i}\left(V\right)\cdot\left(V-E_{i}\right), $$ {#eq:I-as-sum}

\noindent where $E_{i}$ is the reversal potential of channel $i$. Combining Eqs$\,$@eq:G-exp-def and @eq:I-as-sum and using 

$$\begin{aligned}\Delta\left(G_{i}\left(V\right)\cdot\left(V-E_{i}\right)\right)&=\Delta\left(G_{i}\left(V\right)\right)\cdot\left(V-E_{i}\right)+
G_{i}\left(V\right)\cdot\Delta\left(V-E_{i}\right)\\\nonumber
&=\Delta\left(G_{i}\left(V\right)\right)\cdot\left(V-E_{i}\right)+G_{i}\left(V\right)\cdot\Delta V\end{aligned}$$
results in an overall membrane conductance 

$$ G_{\mathrm{m}}^{\mathrm{exp}}=\underset{i}{\sum}\frac{\Delta\left(G_{i}\left(V\right)\cdot\left(V-E_{i}\right)\right)}{\Delta V}=
\underset{i}{\sum}\frac{\Delta\left(G_{i}\left(V\right)\right)}{\Delta V}\left(V-E_{i}\right)+\underset{i}{\sum}G_{i}\left(V\right). $$ {#eq:G-m-def}

\noindent As one can see, the definition used in the original study (Eq.$\,$@eq:G-model-def) excludes the first term. To demonstrate the difference in 
these two definitions, we simulate isolated pyramidal neurons (parameters are set to average values) with DC inputs of different amplitudes injected for 20 seconds into the soma and
record the membrane potential (Fig.$\,$@fig:IV$\,\!$A) as well as all ionic channel conductances. A long pulse duration is chosen here to take into account 
the long time required for the model neuron to reach a steady state. Then we compute membrane conductance according to Eq.$\,$@eq:G-m-def and Eq.$\,$@eq:G-model-def
a few milliseconds before the DC input is switched off. The I-V curve shows a profound nonlinearity (Fig.$\,$@fig:IV$\,\!$B) leading to $G_{\mathrm{m}}^{\mathrm{exp}}$
(the reciprocal of the slope of the I-V curve) reaching $0.012\,\mathrm{nS}$ (corresponding to $83\,\mathrm{G}\Omega$), while $G_{\mathrm{m}}^{\mathrm{model}}$ remains near $15\,\mathrm{nS}$
(corresponding to $0.07\,\mathrm{G}\Omega$) (Fig.$\,$@fig:IV$\,\!$C). Therefore, under the protocol mimicking a standard electrophysiological procedure, the instantaneous chord 
and steady-state slope conductances deviate by several orders of magnitude for the present neuron model. To measure the steady-state slope conductance 
(Eq.$\,$@eq:G-exp-def) during ongoing network activity in the model, we use the virtual hyperpolarization method (see Methods). Freezing the state of the neuron 
as done in this method is necessary because of the aforementioned long relaxation time of the model neurons, which necessitates pulse durations that exceed 
the length of an Up state and therefore prevents measuring steady-state resistances during freely evolving activity. The results of this method for the above 
case of prolonged DC stimulation closely match those obtained from the I-V curve (Fig.$\,$@fig:IV$\,\!$C). In the active network model, this method results in a membrane 
conductance around $2\,\mathrm{nS}$ (corresponding to $500\,\mathrm{M}\Omega$) during the Down state (Fig.$\,$@fig:R-mod$\,\!$B,C). During the Up states, however, membrane conductance tends 
to drop to zero and even becomes negative for  $5-75\,\mathrm{ms}$ with an average of $32\,\mathrm{ms}$ before oncoming spike events, indicating self-depolarizing dynamics in the subthreshold periods. Note that in Fig.$\,$@fig:R-mod$\,\!$B,C time periods of $5\,\mathrm{ms}$
before and after each spike event are not considered to avoid the contamination of subthreshold dynamics with spikes.

construction of an I-V curve.** **(A)** A $10\,\mathrm{s}$ DC injection (inside the region marked by vertical dashed lines) with various amplitudes into the

Membrane conductance measured with the method suggested by the authors of [@Compte03_2707] (Eq.$\,$@eq:G-model-def; dashed curve), is around $15\,\mathrm{nS}$ (corresponding to a 
$70\,\mathrm{M}\Omega$ resistance) for the neuron being hyper- or depolarized by $\Delta V=-3$--$7\,\mathrm{mV}$ by DC currents. Membrane conductance measured according to Eq.$\,$@eq:G-m-def (solid curve), reaches $0.012\,\mathrm{nS}$ (corresponding to a $83\,\mathrm{G}\Omega$
resistance). The virtual hyperpolarization method (circles, see Methods) closely reproduces the latter conductance measure. ](../code/fig8.png){#fig:IV}

Finally, in the original work modification of e-to-i and i-to-e synaptic weights by $10$% results in noticeable differences in spiking activity, though oscillations are qualitatively 
preserved  (see their Figure 6). In our model, however, similar modification of synaptic weights results in negligible differences in spiking activity. Also, when AMPA, NDMA, or GABA conductances are blocked in the model, corresponding changes in the spiking pattern are similar in the original (their Figure 9) and the present model 
(Fig.$\,$@fig:result-block). 

![**When AMPA, NMDA, or GABA channels are blocked in the model, simulation reproduces the results reported in the original Figure 9.** Spiking activity is visualized as 
multi-unit recordings with recording sites spatially separated by $250\,\mathrm{\mu m}$. Each site records from neurons within a $50\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ range.](../code/fig10.png){#fig:result-block}
 
# Conclusion

After modifications to the model with respect to synaptic dynamics and strength, we are able to reproduce the majority of the original results concerning 
spontaneously generated and stimulation-evoked Up-Down 
oscillations. In particular, the dynamics of membrane potentials, membrane resistances, channel conductances, intracellular concentrations of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$
and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ions, and spiking activity closely resemble those of the original model. In our implementation, the synaptic dynamics does not 
depend on the shapes of individual presynaptic action potentials, but just incorporates the average postsynaptic effect of an action potential. The 
fact that we can reproduce the emerging network phenomena suggests that this detail of the synapse model is not relevant on the network level. 
We provide 
a closer look at the method which the authors of the original study use to access neuronal conductance (or resistance). Their measure reflects an 
“instantaneous chord conductance”, which results in the model in values around $15\,\mathrm{nS}$ in an isolated pyramidal neuron, and around $20\,\mathrm{nS}$ throughout network activity. In experimental works, the typical measure approximates 
a “steady-state slope conductance” (see [@Jack1983] for classification), which results in a membrane conductance of less than $1\,\mathrm{nS}$ for a slightly depolarized isolated pyramidal neuron. Throughout network activity, this yields around $2\,\mathrm{nS}$ during Down states, strongly fluctuating membrane conductance during subthreshold Up state periods, and a strong negative conductance lasting on average $32\,\mathrm{ms}$ before each spike event. These low and even negative long-lasting conductances are typically not reported in the experimental literature. Therefore, the dynamics of membrane conductance in the model merits further investigation. 
The present model successfully reproduces the network response to blockade of AMPA, NMDA, or GABA channels. However, 
the sensitivity of the present model to changes in the synaptic strengths is weaker than in the original model.  

We could not obtain the desired network regime with the synaptic weights reported in the original work after calibration to account for the change in the synaptic model. 
We suggest the synaptic dynamics to be the source of discrepancy, as suggested by the inconsistency between our synapse implementation and 
the results shown in the original Figure 5C. 

Apart from these differences in synaptic dynamics, we confirm the correctness of the original implementation of the model.
