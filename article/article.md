# Introduction

We propose a reference implementation of [@guthrie:2013] that introduces an
action selection mechanism in cortico-basal ganglia loops based on a
competition between the positive feedback, direct pathway through the striatum
and the negative feedback, hyperdirect pathway through the subthalamic nucleus.
The original implementation was made in Delphi (Object Pascal) whose sources
are available on request to any of the author of the original article. We have
used these sources to disambiguate ambiguous and missing information in the
original article. The reference implementation we propose has been coded in
Python for ease of reading and Cython for performances because the main result
includes a batch of 250 experiments over 120 trials that would be too slow for
regular Python scripts.

# Methods

We used the description of the model in the original article as well as the
sources of the model (requested from author) that are made of a hundred files
and 6,000 lines of Delphi for the main source. We have been unable to compile
this original implementation but we were able to run the provided Windows
executable. We found some factual errors in the original article that have been
corrected in this implementation. The initialization of weights are defined in
two different parts of the paper. First on page 3030 (second column) *"Weights
were initialized to a Gaussian distribution with a mean of 0.5 and a SD
of 0.005 at the start of each simulation..."*, then on page 3031 in the caption
of figure 4, *"All synaptic weights were initialized to 0.5"*. It happened that
both definitions are right but do not address the same projections.
Cortico-striatal synaptic weights use Gaussian distribution while all other
weights are set to 0.5. Furthermore, the Boltzmann equation given in the
original paper uses a ``.`` instead of ``+`` between first term and second term.

\ 

One notable modification in our implementation is the reinforcement learning
rule that has been greatly simplified. Original authors have been using quite a
complex algorithm for ensuring that *"corticostriatal weights are bounded by a
sigmoidal transfer function to represent physical constraints on synaptic
growth with an absolute maximum of 0.75 and an absolute minimum
of 0.25."*. This algorithm is not described in the article, but from sources,
it appears that it is based on the estimation of the weight gradient along the
sigmoid. We use instead an Oja-like rule given in the *Synapse* table.

\ 

We provide below the formal description of the model according to the
proposition of Nordlie et al. [@nordlie:2009] for reproducible descriptions of
neuronal network models.

# Results
    
We did not reproduce all analyses of the original article but concentrated our
efforts on the main results which are illustrated on figures 4 & 5 in the
original article [@guthrie:2013].

\ 

We first reproduce the activity in the cortical populations during a single
trial, prior to learning. Noise has a great influence on the overall dynamic
and it is not possible to exactly reproduce figure 4 in the original article
without precise information on the underlying random generator(seed).
Consequently, we can only report a qualitatively equivalent figure where the
most critical feature is the bifurcation in cognitive and motor activities
after stimulus onset. Since no learning has occured yet, it is also possible
to have the motor decision to occur before the cognitive decision. Figure 1
shows an example of a decision dynamic with an oscillatory regime between
time t=0 and time t=500ms that is characteristic of the model.

![**Activity in the cortical population during a single trial of action selection.**
  This is the reproduction of figure 4 in the original article.](../code/figure-1.pdf)

\ 

We also tested the learning capacity of the model by reproducing the same procedure
as in the original article (250 experiments, 120 trials) but we used a modified
and simpler learning rule (see Plasiticity table) since the original learning
rule used a sigmodial transfer function but no actual details were given on how
to enforce it.

# Conclusion

After some minor corrections and modifications of the original description of
the model, we were able to reproduce the original results, confirming the
correctness of the original implementation of the model.
