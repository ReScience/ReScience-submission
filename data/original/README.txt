Original input images for stippling papers

These images are the original input for the figures in "Weighted Voronoi
Stippling" published at NPAR 2002 and the Master's thesis "Random Marks on
Paper: Non-photorealistic Rendering with Small Primitives" published by the
Department of Computer Science at the University of British Columbia in 2002.

If you're trying to reproduce my results, please note that the figures in the
NPAR paper all have fixed-radius stipples.  Several figures in my Master's
thesis have variable-radius stipples, which produce far superior results in my
opinion.

These original images are copyright 2002 Adrian Secord and all rights are
reserved.  Please contact me for publication permission -- it will normally
be granted.  Stipple drawings produced from these images are not copyrighted
by me, of course!
