                 tensor imaging. It consists of estimating an effective
                 diffusion tensor, Deff, within a voxel, and then displaying
                 useful quantities derived from it. We show how the phenomenon
                 of anisotropic diffusion of water (or metabolites) in
                 anisotropic tissues, measured noninvasively by these NMR
                 methods, is exploited to determine fiber tract orientation and
                 mean particle displacements. Once Deff is estimated from a
                 series of NMR pulsed-gradient, spin-echo experiments, a
                 tissue's three orthotropic axes can be determined. They
                 coincide with the eigenvectors of Deff, while the effective
                 diffusivities along these orthotropic directions are the
                 eigenvalues of Deff. Diffusion ellipsoids, constructed in each
                 voxel from Deff, depict both these orthotropic axes and the
                 mean diffusion distances in these directions. Moreover, the
                 three scalar invariants of Deff, which are independent of the
                 tissue's orientation in the laboratory frame of reference,
                 reveal useful information about molecular mobility reflective

                 about the relative organization and structure of the

                 both tissue and a fast diffusing component such as free water,
                 a single diffusion tensor is no longer appropriate. A
                 two-tensor free water elimination model has previously been
                 proposed to correct for the case of volume mixing. Here, this
                 model was implemented in a straightforward but novel manner
                 without the use of spatial constraints. The optimal
                 acquisition parameters were investigated through Monte Carlo
                 simulations and human brain imaging studies. At a

              MRI that can be used to measure structural features of brain
              white matter. Many methods have been developed to use dMRI data
              to model the local configuration of white matter nerve fiber
              bundles and infer the trajectory of bundles connecting different
              parts of the brain. Dipy gathers implementations of many
              different methods in dMRI, including: diffusion signal
              pre-processing; reconstruction of diffusion distributions in
              individual voxels; fiber tractography and fiber track
              post-processing, analysis and visualization. Dipy aims to provide
              transparent implementations for all the different steps of dMRI
              analysis with a uniform programming interface. We have
              implemented classical signal reconstruction techniques, such as
              the diffusion tensor model and deterministic fiber tractography.
              In addition, cutting edge novel reconstruction techniques are
              implemented, such as constrained spherical deconvolution and
              diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) with deconvolution, as well as
              methods for probabilistic tracking and original methods for
              tractography clustering. Many additional utility functions are
              provided to calculate various statistics, informative

              encourages contributions from any scientist/developer through
              GitHub and open discussions on the project mailing list.
              Consequently, Dipy today has an international team of

                 Degradation of white matter microstructure is increasingly
                 recognized as a general mechanism of cognitive deterioration
                 with aging. However, atrophy of gray matter regions also occurs
                 and, to date, the potential role of specific white matter connections
                 has been largely ignored. Changes to frontotemporal tracts may
                 be important for the decline of episodic memory; while frontotemporal
                 cooperation is known to be critical, the precise pathways of interaction
                 are unknown. Diffusion-weighted MRI tractography was used to reconstruct
                 three candidate fasciculi known to link components of memory networks:
                 the fornix, the parahippocampal cingulum, and the uncinate fasciculus.
                 Age-related changes in the microstructure of these tracts were
                 investigated in 40 healthy older adults between the ages of 53 and 93 years.
                 The relationships between aging, microstructure, and episodic
                 memory were assessed for each individual tract. Age-related
                 reductions of mean fractional anisotropy and/or increased mean
                 diffusivity were found in all three tracts. However, age-related
                 decline in recall was specifically associated with degradation
                 of fornix microstructure, consistent with the view that this
                 tract is important for episodic memory. In contrast, a decline
                 in uncinate fasciculus microstructure was linked to impaired
                 error monitoring in a visual object-location association task,
                 echoing the effects of uncinate transection in monkeys. These
                 results suggest that degradation of microstructure in the fornix
                 and the uncinate fasciculus make critical but differential
                 contributions to the mechanisms underlying age-related cognitive

                 (DTI) is limited when an image voxel contains partial volume of
                 brain tissue with free water, such as cerebrospinal fluid or
                 edema, rendering the DTI indices no longer useful for describing
                 the underlying tissue properties. We propose here a method
                 for separating diffusion properties of brain tissue from surrounding
                 free water while mapping the free water volume. This
                 is achieved by fitting a bi-tensor model for which a mathematical
                 framework is introduced to stabilize the fitting. Applying the
                 method on datasets from a healthy subject and a patient with
                 edema yielded corrected DTI indices and a more complete tract
                 reconstruction that passed next to the ventricles and through
                 the edema. We were able to segment the edema into areas
                 according to the condition of the underlying tissue. In addition,
                 the volume of free water is suggested as a new quantitative
                 contrast of diffusion MRI. The findings suggest that free water
                 is not limited to the borders of the brain parenchyma; it therefore
                 contributes to the architecture surrounding neuronal bundles
                 and may indicate specific anatomical processes. The analysis

                 it is more beneficial to use a large number of gradient sampling
                 orientations in diffusion tensor MRI (DT-MRI) experiments than to
                 use a smaller number of carefully chosen orientations. In this study,
                 Monte Carlo simulations were used to study the effect of using
                 different gradient sampling schemes on estimates of tensor-derived
                 quantities assuming a b-value of 1000 smm–2. The study focused
                 in particular on the effect that the number of unique gradient
                 orientations has on uncertainty in estimates of tensor-orientation,
                 and on estimates of the trace and anisotropy of the diffusion
                 tensor. The results challenge the recently proposed notion that
                 a set of six icosahedrally-arranged orientations is optimal for
                 DT-MRI. It is shown that at least 20 unique sampling
                 orientations are necessary for a robust estimation of anisotropy,
                 whereas at least 30 unique sampling orientations are required
                 for a robust estimation of tensor-orientation and mean diffusivity.
                 Finally, the performance of sampling schemes that use low numbers
                 of sampling orientations, but make efficient use of available
                 gradient power, are compared to less efficient schemes with
                 larger numbers of sampling orientations, and the relevant
                 scenarios in which each type of scheme should be used are discussed.",

  abstract    = "Diffusion MRI is used extensively to investigate changes in white matter microstructure
                 related to brain development and pathology. Ageing, however, is also associated with
                 significant white and grey matter loss which in turn can lead to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) based partial volume artefacts in diffusion MRI
                 metrics. This is especially problematic in regions prone to CSF contamination, such as the fornix and the
                 genu of corpus callosum, structures that pass through or close to the ventricles respectively. The aim of
                 this study was to model the effects of CSF contamination on diffusion MRI metrics, and to evaluate different
                 post-acquisition strategies to correct for CSF-contamination: Controlling for whole brain volume and correcting
                 on a voxel-wise basis using the Free Water Elimination (FWE) approach. Using the fornix as an exemplar
                 of a structure prone to CSF-contamination, corrections were applied to tract-specific and voxel-based [tract
                 based spatial statistics (TBSS)] analyses of empirical DT-MRI data from 39 older adults (53–93 years of
                 age). In addition to significant age-related decreases in whole brain volume and fornix tissue volume fraction,
                 age was also associated with a reduction in mean fractional anisotropy and increase in diffusivity metrics in
                 the fornix. The experimental data agreed with the simulations in that diffusivity metrics (mean diffusivity,
                 axial and radial diffusivity) were more prone to partial volume CSF-contamination errors than fractional
                 anisotropy. After FWE-based voxel-by-voxel partial volume corrections, the significant positive correlations
                 between age and diffusivity metrics, in particular with axial diffusivity, disappeared whereas the correlation
                 with anisotropy remained. In contrast, correcting for whole brain volume had little effect in removing these
                 spurious correlations. Our study highlights the importance of correcting for CSF-contamination partial volume
                 effects in the structures of interest on a voxel-by-voxel basis prior to drawing inferences about underlying
                 changes in white matter structures and have implications for the interpretation of many recent diffusion MRI

                 in schizophrenia in vivo. However, the role of these abnormalities in the etiology of
                 schizophrenia is not well understood. Accumulating evidence from imaging, histological, genetic,
                 and immunochemical studies support the involvement of axonal degeneration and
                 neuroinflammation--ubiquitous components of neurodegenerative disorders--as the underlying
                 pathologies of these abnormalities. Nevertheless, the current imaging modalities cannot

                 with respect to the pathophysiology progression and whether it is related to a neurodegenerative
                 process. Free-water imaging is a new methodology that is sensitive to water molecules diffusing
                 in the extracellular space. Excessive extracellular volume is a surrogate biomarker for
                 neuroinflammation and can be separated out to reveal abnormalities such as axonal degeneration

                 In contrast, significant signs of axonal degeneration were limited to focal areas in the
                 frontal lobe white matter. Our findings demonstrate that neuroinflammation is more prominent
                 than axonal degeneration in the early stage of schizophrenia, revealing a pattern shared by
                 many neurodegenerative disorders, in which prolonged inflammation leads to axonal degeneration.

                 health problem for the general population. Traumatic axonal
                 injury has been associated with concussions (also referred
                 to as mild traumatic brain injuries), yet the pathological
                 course that leads from injury to recovery or to long-term
                 sequelae is still not known. This study investigated the
                 longitudinal course of concussion by comparing diffusion MRI
                 (dMRI) scans of the brains of ice hockey players before and
                 after a concussion. METHODS: The 2011-2012 Hockey Concussion
                 Education Project followed 45 university-level ice hockey
                 players (both male and female) during a single Canadian
                 Interuniversity Sports season. Of these, 38 players had usable
                 dMRI scans obtained in the preseason. During the season,
                 11 players suffered a concussion, and 7 of these 11 players
                 had usable dMRI scans that were taken within 72 hours of injury.
                 To analyze the data, the authors performed free-water imaging,
                 which reflects an increase in specificity over other dMRI
                 analysis methods by identifying alterations that occur in the
                 extracellular space compared with those that occur in proximity
                 to cellular tissue in the white matter. They used an
                 individualized approach to identify alterations that are
                 spatially heterogeneous, as is expected in concussions.
                 RESULTS: Paired comparison of the concussed players before
                 and after injury revealed a statistically significant (p < 0.05)
                 common pattern of reduced free-water volume and reduced axial
                 and radial diffusivities following elimination of free-water.
                 These free-water-corrected measures are less affected by partial
                 volumes containing extracellular water and are therefore more
                 specific to processes that occur within the brain tissue.
                 Fractional anisotropy was significantly increased, but this
                 change was no longer significant following the free-water
                 elimination. CONCLUSIONS: Concussion during ice hockey games
                 results in microstructural alterations that are detectable
                 using dMRI. The alterations that the authors found suggest
                 decreased extracellular space and decreased diffusivities
                 in white matter tissue. This finding might be explained by swelling
                 and/or by increased cellularity of glia cells. Even though these
                 findings in and of themselves cannot determine whether the
                 observed microstructural alterations are related to long-term
                 pathology or persistent symptoms, they are important nonetheless
                 because they establish a clearer picture of how the brain
                 responds to concussion.",
