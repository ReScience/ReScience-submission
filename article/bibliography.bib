@article{Fellous2004,
abstract = {When a cortical neuron is repeatedly injected with the same fluctuating current stimulus (frozen noise) the timing of the spikes is highly precise from trial to trial and the spike pattern appears to be unique. We show here that the same repeated stimulus can produce more than one reliable temporal pattern of spikes. A new method is introduced to find these patterns in raw multitrial data and is tested on surrogate data sets. Using it, multiple coexisting spike patterns were discovered in pyramidal cells recorded from rat prefrontal cortex in vitro, in data obtained in vivo from the middle temporal area of the monkey (Buracas et al., 1998) and from the cat lateral geniculate nucleus (Reinagel and Reid, 2002). The spike patterns lasted from a few tens of milliseconds in vitro to several seconds in vivo. We conclude that the prestimulus history of a neuron may influence the precise timing of the spikes in response to a stimulus over a wide range of time scales.},

@article{Stimberg2014,
abstract = {Simulating biological neuronal networks is a core method of research in computational neuroscience. A full specification of such a network model includes a description of the dynamics and state changes of neurons and synapses, as well as the synaptic connectivity patterns and the initial values of all parameters. A standard approach in neuronal modeling software is to build network models based on a library of pre-defined components and mechanisms; if a model component does not yet exist, it has to be defined in a special-purpose or general low-level language and potentially be compiled and linked with the simulator. Here we propose an alternative approach that allows flexible definition of models by writing textual descriptions based on mathematical notation. We demonstrate that this approach allows the definition of a wide range of models with minimal syntax. Furthermore, such explicit model descriptions allow the generation of executable code for various target languages and devices, since the description is not tied to an implementation. Finally, this approach also has advantages for readability and reproducibility, because the model description is fully explicit, and because it can be automatically parsed and transformed into formatted descriptions. The presented approach has been implemented in the Brian2 simulator.},

The focus is on making the writing of simulation code as quick and easy as possible for the user, and on flexibility: new and non-standard models are no more difficult to define than standard ones. This allows scientists to spend more time on the details of their models, and less on their implementation. Neuron models are defined by writing differential equations in standard mathematical notation, facilitating scientific communication. Brian is written in the Python programming language, and uses vector-based computation to allow for efficient simulations.

@article{Prut1998,
abstract = {The study was designed to reveal occurrences of precise firing sequences (PFSs) in cortical activity and to test their behavioral relevance. Two monkeys were trained to perform a delayed-response paradigm and to open puzzle boxes. Extracellular activity was recorded from neurons in premotor and prefrontal areas with an array of six microelectrodes. An algorithm was developed to detect PFSs, defined as a set of three spikes and two intervals with a precision of +/-1 ms repeating significantly more than expected by chance. The expected level of repetition was computed based on the firing rate and the pairwise correlation of the participating units, assuming a Poisson distribution of event counts. Accordingly, the search for PFSs was corrected for rate modulations. PFSs were found in 24/25 recording sessions. Most PFSs (76{\%}) were composed of spikes of more than one unit but usually not more than two units (67{\%}). The PFSs spanned hundreds of milliseconds, and the average interval between two events within the PFSs was 200 ms. No traces of periodic oscillations were found in the PFS intervals. The bins of the matrix that were defined as PFSs were isolated temporally: the spikes that generated PFSs were not associated with high-frequency bursts or rapid coherent rate fluctuations. A given PFS tended to be correlated with the animal's behavior. Furthermore, for 19{\%} of the PFS pairs that shared the same unit composition, each member of the pair was associated with a different type of behavior. The PFSs often appeared in clusters that were associated with particular phases of the behavior. The firing rate of single units did not provide a full explanation for the timing and structure of these clusters. A reduced spike train (RST) was defined for each unit by taking all spikes of that unit that were part of any PFS. In 88{\%} of the cases the degree of modulation of the RST was higher than that of the complete spike train. The results suggest that relevant information is carried by the fine temporal structure of cortical activity. A coding scheme that involves such temporal structures is rich and sufficiently flexible to facilitate a rapid organization of cortical neurons into functional groups. The results can be accounted for by the synfire chain model, which suggests that cortical activity is mediated by synchronous activation of neural groups in a reverberatory mode.},

abstract = {Synaptic plasticity is considered to be the bio-logical substrate of learning and memory. In this document we review phenomenological models of short-term and long-term synaptic plasticity, in particular spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP). The aim of the document is to provide a framework for classifying and evaluating different models of plasticity. We focus on phenomenological synaptic models that are compatible with integrate-and-fire type neuron models where each neuron is described by a small number of variables. This implies that synaptic update rules for short-term or long-term plasticity can only depend on spike timing and, potentially, on membrane potential, as well as on the value of the synaptic weight, or on low-pass filtered (tempo-rally averaged) versions of the above variables. We examine the ability of the models to account for experimental data and to fulfill expectations derived from theoretical considera-tions. We further discuss their relations to teacher-based rules (supervised learning) and reward-based rules (reinforcement learning). All models discussed in this paper are suitable for large-scale network simulations.},

@article{Masq2008,
abstract = {Experimental studies have observed Long Term synaptic Potentiation (LTP) when a presynaptic neuron fires shortly before a postsynaptic neuron, and Long Term Depression (LTD) when the presynaptic neuron fires shortly after, a phenomenon known as Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP). When a neuron is presented successively with discrete volleys of input spikes STDP has been shown to learn 'early spike patterns', that is to concentrate synaptic weights on afferents that consistently fire early, with the result that the postsynaptic spike latency decreases, until it reaches a minimal and stable value. Here, we show that these results still stand in a continuous regime where afferents fire continuously with a constant population rate. As such, STDP is able to solve a very difficult computational problem: to localize a repeating spatio-temporal spike pattern embedded in equally dense 'distractor' spike trains. STDP thus enables some form of temporal coding, even in the absence of an explicit time reference. Given that the mechanism exposed here is simple and cheap it is hard to believe that the brain did not evolve to use it.},
